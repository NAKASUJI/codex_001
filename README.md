This repository includes a simple Tetris game implemented with Python's
`curses` module. Use the arrow keys to move the falling pieces and press
`q` to quit.

## Running the Game

Run the following command from this directory:

```bash
python3 tetris.py
```

The game opens in the terminal. Use:
- Left/Right arrows to move pieces
- Up arrow to rotate
- Down arrow to accelerate downward movement
- `q` to quit

The board uses colored backgrounds for each block and shows the next piece on
the right side of the playfield.

The right side of the board shows which piece will fall next.

Enjoy!

This repository includes a simple Tetris game implemented with Python's
`curses` module. Use the arrow keys to move the falling pieces and press
`q` to quit.

## Running the Game

Run the following command from this directory:

```bash
python3 tetris.py
```

The game opens in the terminal. Use:
- Left/Right arrows to move pieces
- Up arrow to rotate
- Down arrow to accelerate downward movement
- `q` to quit


The right side of the board shows which piece will fall next.

Enjoy!
